## Introduction

As in almost every game, having money allows you to do a lot more. In this guide, we’ll help you make trillions quickly so that you can unlock high value eggs, expand storages, and more.

## General rules

### Some things to keep in mind as you play the game. These rules will be focused on money making, so just keep them in mind as you play if this is your main goal.


- These money making methods are still subject to the randomness of this game. They’ll make you money in the long run, but it’s possible to have unlucky streaks that may lose you money short-term.  Trust the methods - they work
- Following the last rule, it’s not necessary to do more at a time (ex. Saving up 100 dirty eggs) - it just may feel better since you’re more likely to come out ahead on a larger batch of eggs
- You don’t need to keep 1 of every egg - they’re only for collection & being able to set it as your profile pic. If you get a new rare egg, don’t be afraid to sell it to move to higher value cleans
- In terms of cleans, at lower levels everything is (mathematically) profitable. The values given here are suggestions for what works the best / is more consistent, but other values can still work
- Don’t spend money when it’s more than 10% of your current wallet - slows down your growth as it'll prevent you from moving to higher value cleans


## Starting out - Early game

### This section is for people with under 1b in wallet

If you’ve just started the game, you’ll want to get to level 7 as quickly as possible to unlock 700k scrambles.  While doing this, collect as many eggs and free tap blasts/scrambles as you can.  After reaching level 7, your goal is to save up for 700k scrambles and do as many as you can.  For this stage, I’d recommend letting your blue gems max out, so you can only collect red gems to use for this.

700k scrambles are extremely consistent, as you’ll profit more often than not while keeping decent chances of rolling 1m, 5m, and sometimes 10m+ eggs.

Once you reach a decent size wallet (25m+), you can start doing dirty egg cleans in addition to scrambles. Although you may need to keep doing scrambles to support the cost & supplement the income, these cleans will allow you to get a higher chance to roll valuable eggs such as 1 in 1 billion and above.

At this point in the game, you should be using either 1.3m or 2.5m sauce for cleans. These are recommended as you’ll have a good chance to roll 1m, 5m, and 10m eggs while keeping a possibility of getting 100m and 1b eggs.

Check out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L66S3tMoRRhWE70PmGYDpsJ549W24aHTSoc-BuL_tJM/edit#gid=0) for more information on egg cleaning.

In terms of spending money, I’d recommend only buying things once they’re less than 10% of your wallet.  This ensures that it doesn’t affect your wallet much so that you can keep doing high level cleans.


## Midgame money making

### This section is for people with over 1b in wallet

Once you’ve reached the midgame, money becomes all about snowballing your wallet with cleans into higher tiers until you eventually reach the one in a trillion eggs and can use billions of sauce per egg.

The most important things to keep in mind here are to follow the cleaning spreadsheet to know when to change the amount of sauce to add and to not be afraid to sell new eggs of high rarity. 

If you get really lucky (ex. pull a 1 in 1 trillion or 2 1 in 100 billion eggs from lower sauce values) you can skip right to 1.3b cleans and enter late game money making.

However, it’s more likely that you’ll slowly accumulate money from these cleans, supplemented by semi-rare (1/77, 1/769) pulls which will eventually allow you to reach the next benchmark listed in the table.  Keep in mind that the suggestions for wallet values are merely that - suggestions.  It may be riskier to start using cleans at lower wallet values than recommended but can work out as long as you don’t go completely broke - just make sure to keep more than the recommended wallet value for the tier below in case you need to fall back on it after an unlucky streak.

A strategy which may help in this stage was suggested by  i_am_god - 
You can regularly do cleans of the value that’s recommended for your current wallet, but then use the profits from that to do the next level clean (so staying around the recommended amount).  This gives a higher chance to get lucky pulls that will allow you to do the same thing at the next tier.  The main downside to this is that you lose the chance to make enough to go to the next tier safely by accumulating money from smaller gains, but it should overall speed up your money making even if it feels much less consistent.

In terms of spending money, I’d recommend only buying things once they’re less than 10% of your wallet.  This ensures that it doesn’t affect your wallet much so that you can keep doing high level cleans.


## Late game money making

### This section is for people with over 1t in wallet

At this point, there are 2 options for further progression, which you can switch between at any time. 

#### If you want to keep maximizing money -
This allows for a quickly expanding wallet to buy storage upgrades and save up for eventual high value cleans.
For this approach, you’ll want to use 3.65b sauce per clean. This value was calculated to provide the maximum profit per clean on average, not counting ??? eggs.

#### If you want to maximize the amount of ??? eggs earned -
This allows for either a ??? collection to flex or eggs to sell for gems to increase your taps through gem pops.
For this approach, you’ll want to use between 3.65b and 12b sauce per clean. At 12b, according to the cleaning spreadsheet, you’ll come out around even in regards to money spent and money earned while having a better chance at ??? eggs. You can do higher values, but keep in mind that you’ll be losing money - just make sure to keep arount 1t as safety in case you need to return to 1.3b or 3.65b cleans.

Now there’s not much to do after this point besides spend your (very hard earned) money!

## Spending money

There are a few things in this game that you can spend money on besides dirty egg cleans.  As suggested in the general rules, you shouldn't buy things over 10% of your wallet since it slows down your money snowball. 

There aren’t really any recommendations as to what to buy, since nothing provides a significant advantage in terms of collection or completion.  However, scavenger hunt eggs are much easier with clues and gem/dirty egg storage is nice for QoL.
